# Neural Network for XNOR Function

This project demonstrates a simple neural network implemented in pure JavaScript for the XNOR function. The XNOR function returns true if both input values are the same and false if they are different. This example provides an interactive way to test the neural network in a web browser.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `neural_network.js`: The JavaScript file implementing the neural network.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or **download the files** to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Project Structure

### index.html

This file contains the structure of the webpage with input fields for the two inputs of the XNOR function, a button to trigger the prediction, and a section to display the output.

### styles.css

This file contains the CSS for styling the webpage.

### neural_network.js

This file contains the JavaScript code for the neural network. It includes functions for initializing weights, the sigmoid activation function and its derivative, forward propagation, backpropagation, and training the neural network.

### Conclusion

The neural network successfully learns to predict the XNOR function. After training, the network can correctly output the expected results for all input combinations. This example demonstrates the basic principles of neural network training, including forward propagation and backpropagation.

This project serves as an educational tool to understand how neural networks work and can be extended to more complex problems and architectures.
